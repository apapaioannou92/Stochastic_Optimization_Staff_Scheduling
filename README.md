# Stochastic Optimization - Staff Scheduling
Creates a labor schedule for a retailer that minimizes total cost while preserving a given service level target. The schedule is built using Python v. 3.7.1 + Gurobi v. 8.1.1 to solve a Mixed Integer Programming problem with probability constraints.

## Background

Brick-and-mortar retail stores employ about 15% of the American workforce. In retail, variable schedules are the norm where schedules typically change every day and every week with three to seven days’ notice of next week’s schedule. Researchers have found that matching labor to incoming traffic is a key driver of retail profitability. Retailers that have adopted more data-driven approaches for scheduling have been able to capture between 4 and 12 % in cost savings among other facets of store operations.

## Problem Statement

Current software solutions used by the majority of retailers produce only generic schedules that fail to account for store-specific factors and workload fluctuations, and they disregard the impacts of scheduling on the service level and staffs’ overall well-beings.

The models explored in this project help improving the profitability of the retailers by minimizing the labor cost without affecting the level of service they provide to customers. The decision variables are listed below
